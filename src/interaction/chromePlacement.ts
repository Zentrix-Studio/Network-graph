 * Corner-stacking math for the floating chrome overlays (NG-136). Pure — no DOM and no
 * Power BI imports — so it is deterministic and unit-testable.
 *
 * Four floating pieces can each be pinned to any of the four corners: the quick-action
 * toolbar (fixed top-right), the settings **gear**, the **view-switch pill**
 * (Graph / Table / Insight), and the **legend**. When two land in the same corner they
 * must not overlap, so occupants are laid out along that corner's horizontal edge in a
 * fixed priority order (closest to the edge first): action bar → gear → pill → legend.
 * Each occupant starts at its own flush inset, or just past the previous occupant —
 * whichever is farther. Widths are fixed constants (the action-bar column is 42px, the
 * collapsed gear 36px) so no `getBBox`/`offsetWidth` measurement is needed and the result
 * is identical under jsdom and a real browser.
